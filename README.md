# Wanderlust

Wanderlust is a dynamic, server-rendered web application inspired by Airbnb, built using Node.js, Express, and EJS templating. This project replicates core functionalities of a travel accommodation platform including create, delete and update the listings—all within a clean, responsive interface styled with vanilla CSS.
 
Core Features:

•	User authentication and session management using Passport.js.
•	Host functionality to create, edit, and delete listings.
•	Review system for user feedback and stars rating system.
•	Image uploads via Cloudinary for listing photos.
•	RESTful routing with clean URL structures and middleware handling.
